# Camera Units Comparison

英文 - **[中文](https://github.com/m5stack/M5-Schematic/blob/master/Units/m5camera/CameraComparison_zh_CN.md)** - **[日本語](https://github.com/m5stack/M5-Schematic/blob/master/Units/m5camera/CameraComparison_ja.md)**

Now, M5Stack has four types of camera units, there are respectively [ESP32CAM](https://docs.m5stack.com/#/en/unit/esp32cam), [M5Camera (A Model)](https://docs.m5stack.com/#/en/unit/m5camera), [M5Camera (B Model)](https://docs.m5stack.com/#/en/unit/m5camera), M5CameraX, [M5CameraF](https://docs.m5stack.com/#/en/unit/m5camera_f).

The main differences between these cameras are **memory**, **interface**, **lens**, **optional hardware** and **camera shell**。

The picture below is their comparison table. (<mark>Note:</mark> Because the interface has many different pins, so I have made a separate table to compare.)
